    Jim Hugunin invented JPython and was the primary developer while
    he was at CNRI.  In February 1999, Jim left CNRI for sunny
    California and Barry Warsaw became the primary maintainer.
    When Barry and the rest of PythonLabs left CNRI, Barry renamed
    JPython to Jython, put the sources on SourceForge and made 
    Finn Bock the primary maintainer.

    Python's inventor Guido van Rossum and the rest of PythonLabs
    continues to help and support Jython by their understanding
    of how Jython must live with the limits of Java.

    You can contact the Jython maintainers directly via
    jython-dev@lists.sourceforge.net, or the Jython community at
    jython-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

    Harry Mantakos contributed the underlying md5 implementation.

    The SHA1 implementation is taken from cryptix.

    Samuele Pedroni has designed and implemented the improved 
    PackageManagers and java reload support and also fixed a lot 
    of bugs.

    Kevin Butler has written and contributed the code for os.environ and 
    os.system().

    Brian Zimmer contributed zxJDBC which is a Python DB API subsystem.

    Cyrille Morvan has written the code for the Jythonc ant task.

    Alan Kennedy contributed modjy, which bridges WSGI to the Servlet API

    Chris Gokey, David Syer and Finn Bock added PyServlet.
    
    Yin Wang and Steve Yegge contributed the static analyzer from Google (also called indexer).
