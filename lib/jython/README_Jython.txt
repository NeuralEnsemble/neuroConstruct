Welcome to Jython 2.7b1
=======================

This is the first beta release of the 2.7 version of Jython. Thanks to
Adconion Media Group (http://www.adconion.com/) for sponsoring this release.
Thanks to all who contribute to Jython.

Jython 2.7b1 brings us up to language level compatibility with the 2.7 version
of CPython. We have focused largely on CPython compatibility, and so this
release of Jython can run more pure Python apps then any previous release.
Please see the NEWS file for detailed release notes. Some notable new features
in this release are: a bytearray implementation, a buffer api, memoryview, a
bz2 module.

As the first beta release, this marks a change in the focus of development
from adding features to bug fixing and on getting more of the test suite
running properly.

Please see the NEWS file for detailed release notes.

The release was compiled on Ubuntu with JDK 7 and requires JDK 6 to run.

Please try this out and report any bugs at http://bugs.jython.org.
