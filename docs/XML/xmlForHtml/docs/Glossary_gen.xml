<b>3D View of Cells</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>When a single cell is viewed in 3D (at tab <strong>Visualisation</strong>, select the name of the <a href="#Cell Type">Cell Type</a> in the drop down box and press <strong>View</strong>)
    there are a number of actions possible:
    <ul>
            
<li>Left click anywhere in the view and drag to rotate the cell</li>
            
<li>Right click anywhere and drag to translate the cell</li>
            
<li>Clicking the middle mouse button and dragging (or turning the middle wheel) will zoom the view. Note that if there
            is no middle button, there is a zoom slider bar on the GUI</li>
            
<li>Pressing the <strong>0</strong> button will reset the view, usually centering on the cell</li>
            
<li>Pressing the <strong>^</strong> button will open a window in full screen with just the 3D objects (good for capturing screenshots)</li>
            
<li>Left clicking on one of <a href="#Segments">Segments</a> will highlight that segment (red) and any other segments in the same <a href="#Section">Section</a> (yellow) (only when <strong>All solid</strong> is selected)</li>
            
<li>When a Segment is selected, a summary of the 3D information on it appears, and the endpoints, etc. can be altered by pressing the <strong>Edit...</strong> button</li>
    
</ul>
    Specifying <a href="#Section Groups">Section Groups</a> allows different subsections of the cell to be assigned as dendrites, etc. and can be used to colour regions of the cells.
    When multiple cells are being displayed (e.g. when <strong>Latest Generated Positions</strong> is selected, or a simulation is reloaded) the following options are also possible:
        <ul>
            
<li>Clicking on part of a cell highlights that cell. Note this is easiest when the level of detail displayed is <strong>All Solid</strong> (see below). Selecting cells can also be
                difficult is other objects are close, e.g. transparent regions, synaptic endpoint spheres, 3D axes (turn some of these off via <strong>3D Settings</strong>). If a cell can't be selected by clicking, the cell group and cell number can be selected in the drop down boxes.</li>
                
<li>Multiple cells in a cell group can be selected too via the drop down boxes (e.g. all cells, a percentage of cells, etc.). These can then be plotted together as a group if a previous simulation has been loaded.</li>
            
<li>When one or more cells are selected, checking the <strong>Transparent mode</strong> box keeps that/those cell opaque, makes cells it is/they are connected to partially transparent and turns other cells almost completely transparent.</li>

        
</ul>
    There are a number of settings which can be changed by pressing the <strong>3D Settings</strong> button:
        <ul>
            
<li>The background colour and preferred cell segment colour</li>
            
<li>Whether the <a href="#Axes in 3D">3D axes</a> will be shown.</li>
            
<li>The resolution of 3D elements. <strong>Note for better 3D performance when viewing large cells/networks this should be set low (&lt;12)!</strong>
</li>
            
<li>A number of items can be excluded or included from the 3D view, e.g. Regions (when viewing generated networks), Inputs, Synaptic Endponts (green for presynaptic location, red for post), etc.</li>
            
<li>The level of detail to display (see below)</li>
        
</ul>
        The default view for 3D cells is to show all the segments in full solid detail (spheres or cylinders/truncated cones). However this can be too much detail to show on many
        machines for large cells. The following options allow different views of the cells, either at reduced details, or transformed for a particular simulator:
        <ul>
            
<li>
<strong>All solid:</strong> all segments are seen in 3D detail. Note the resolution of these can be increased or decreased under <strong>3D Settings</strong>
</li>
            
<li>
<strong>Soma solid, neurite lines:</strong> segments in the soma group are solid, all other segments are lines through their centres</li>
            
<li>
<strong>Soma solid, no neurites:</strong> just the soma segments are shown in 3D</li>
            
<li>
<strong>All lines:</strong> all segments are represented by lines</li>
            
<li>
<strong>Original Compartmentalisation:</strong> a transparent view of the cell, showing the segments in 3D, white lines through their centres, blue spheres
            for their end points, and yellow lines linking segments which are electrically connected, but not physically linked. There will be a red sphere in
            the middle of each of the <a href="#internal divisions">internal divisions</a>, with small blue spheres connecting them. These red spheres correspond to the simulated
            points in NEURON as defined by the <a href="#nseg">nseg</a> value.</li>
            
<li>
<strong>GENESIS Compartmentalisation:</strong> this is a <a href="#Compartmentalisation">Compartmentalisation</a> of the cell which converts it to a smaller number of compartments for GENESIS
            but retains the section groups, total surface area, total dendritic length and total axial resistance.</li>

        
</ul>
        Note: see points on allocating extra memory for the application <a href="install.html#Building+and+running">here</a>, which will be important when displaying large networks in 3D. Also,
        there is sometimes excessive flickering when showing 3D on Windows (a common problem when mixing Java3D and Swing, see <a href="http://www.int.com/products/3d/jview3d/problem_resolution/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>), try updating the drivers for your graphics card, or adding <strong>-Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true</strong> to the command in nC.bat.

<b>Abstract Cell</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>A <a href="#Cell Type">Cell Type</a> which represents a real neuron, but whose morphology is described with a much reduced number of segments.
        These types of cells are useful for investigating basic electrophysiological properties of cells, or in large networks, where simpler individual cells
        are needed to reduce simulation time. These cells can be created manually by adding a Cell Type based on the included examples (e.g. SimpleCell), viewing in tab <strong>Visualisation</strong>,
        clicking on one of the segments, and pressing <strong>Edit...</strong>.</p>

<p>A <a href="#Cell Mechanism">Cell Mechanism</a> which has been split between model template and parameters, allowing easy mapping onto
                 each of the available simulation platforms. <strong>Note: This is a pre-</strong><a href="#ChannelML">ChannelML</a><strong> approach to implementing

<b>Action Potential Propagation Speed</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>While the 3D structure of axons is important for creating the correct connectivity (e.g parallel fibers in cerebellar granule cells)
        the segments representing these axons need not necessarily be explicitly modelled, indeed physiological data on the channels
        present etc. can be quite difficult to obtain. Instead an average value for the speed of propagation of the Action Potential can
        be used for these segments, with the axonal propagation delay (calculated using the distance along the segments to the last fully modelled segment)
        added to the internal synaptic mechanism delay. To specify sections which should be modelled using Action Potential Propagation Speeds, select
        <a href="#Cell density mechanism">Cell density mechanism</a> in the drop down box when viewing a single cell in the <strong>Visualisation</strong> tab. Note that reducing the number of
        explicitly modelled segments will reduce the simulation runtime.</p>

<p>If anti-aliasing is turned on, 3D renderings of both solid compartments and line segments will be smoother. This may have some performance overhead on some video cards,
    or may prevent the 3D view from displaying, and so should be turned off. </p>

<p>A set of axes can be added in 3D (either when a single cell is being displayed or a generated network). The green axis represents
             the x direction, the yellow the y direction and the red the z direction. The axes measure 100 microns from the origin in positive
             and negative directions, the arrow on the positive. The ticks are at 10 micron intervals. Due to perspective the axes should only be
             used for getting bearings/a concept of scale in the 3D scene.</p>

<p>A number of checks can be carried out on the cells in a project to ensure they meet some minimum
         requirements for producing realistic results in the chosen simulators. <strong>It is not a complete list.</strong> At the moment these checks are:
         <ul>
             
<li>At least one membrane mechanism on each segment</li>
             
<li>At least one passive conductance on each segment </li>
             
<li>Each section has an appropriate <a href="#internal number of divisions">internal number of divisions</a> for the specified maximum <a href="#electrotonic length">electrotonic length</a>
</li>
         
</ul>

         The following checks, when failed, lead to warnings:
         <ul>
             
<li>At most one passive conductance on a segment (more than one can lead to erroneous calculations of <a href="#Electrotonic length">Electrotonic length</a>)</li>
         
</ul>
         The intention is to expand these checks to make it easier for non/new computational neuroscientists to catch some
         common errors when creating cell models. If there are any suggestions for checks to be made, please <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a>.

<b>Cell density mechanism</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>A term used to describe the mechanisms which can be applied to cell segments to allow simulation of electrophysiological
                 mechanisms. Density refers to the fact that the effect of the mechanism is dependent on the physical size (surface area/length) of the segment. A 
                 <a href="#Channel Mechanism">Channel Mechanism</a> is specified as a conductance per unit area, or alternatively an <a href="#Action Potential Propagation Speed">Action Potential Propagation Speed</a> measures the 
                 rate of propagation of signals along a segment to synaptic connections. Specific capacitance and specific axial resistance can 
                 be specified on a per group basis also. To specify which cell density mechanisms are present on a cell, select
        <strong>Cell density mechanism</strong> in the drop down box when viewing a single cell in the <strong>Visualisation</strong> tab.</p>

<b>Channel Mechanism</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>An implementation of a model of an electrophysiological process (e.g. a voltage gated ion channel, ion pump, etc.) which is placed 
        on modelled cells' membranes to alter their behaviour. For <a href="#NEURON">NEURON</a> these are usually implemented in <a href="#NMODL">NMODL</a>.
        The preferred way to specify these in neuroConstruct is with a <a href="#ChannelML">ChannelML</a> file.</p>

<b>ChannelML</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>ChannelML is a language (using <a href="#XML">XML</a> technologies) for specifying the dynamics of various subcellular processes
        (<a href="#Channel Mechanism">Channel Mechanism</a>s, <a href="#Synaptic Mechanism">Synaptic Mechanism</a>s, etc.) which are present on biologically detailed model neurons.
        It is a part of Level 2 of <a href="#NeuroML">NeuroML</a>.
        The ability to model these types of mechanisms is one of the key features of platforms like <a href="#NEURON">NEURON</a> or <a href="#GENESIS">GENESIS</a>, but the implementation
        of the mechanisms is far from trivial, requiring both knowledge of the physiological processes and of a low level programming language. ChannelML seeks to separate the
        electrophysiological data from any specific implementation, defining a template for numerous types of cellular mechanism, containing only the relevant biophysical parameters
        (e.g. reversal potentials, (in)activation rate equations) which can be automatically validated for completeness. These files can then be mapped to
        script files in the language of the target simulator for inclusion in cell models.
        The format for valid ChannelML files is described in an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/default.asp" target="_blank">XML Schema</a> document.
        Examples of valid ChannelML files and mappings to simulators can be found
        <a href="http://www.neuroml.org/NeuroMLValidator/Samples.jsp" target="_blank">here</a>, and detailed specifications of the elements allowed in a ChannelML document are
        available <a href="http://www.neuroml.org/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=ChannelML" target="_blank">here</a>.
        A description of the current support
                 for MorphML and NeuroML in general in neuroConstruct is available <a href="neuroml.html">here</a> and
        details of the process to convert an existing channel script, e.g. a mod file, to ChannelML is outlined <a href="importneuron.html#Converting+mod+file%2FGENESIS+script+channels+into+ChannelML">here</a>.

                 reorganisation of the structure of segments/sections to retain as many of the properties the cell which are important for electrophysiological
                 simulations (total membrane area, total axial resistance along branches, total length etc.) but enables mapping on to a smaller number of 
                 simulated compartments. See <a href="#GENESIS Compartmentalisation">GENESIS Compartmentalisation</a>. The various Compartmentalisations can be visualised in 3D, see <a href="#3D View of Cells">3D View of Cells</a>.</p>

</a><span>
<p>This measure of the length of dendrites, etc. as "seen" by electrical charge is dependent on the shape, axial
                 and membrane resistance of the section. See the NEURON or GENESIS books for more details. It is important when
                 simulating neurons with realistic morphologies that individually simulated points are not too far apart in terms
                 of electrotonic length (a max of 0.1 is usually fine, though much smaller is needed if trying to match the behaviour of
                 morphologically complex cells between simulators), i.e. a sufficiently fine-graned spatial discretisation
                 should be used. Too short an electrotonic length can sometimes lead to problems in numerical integration, and 
                 neuroConstruct will perform validity checks for both of these (too long and too short). To correct the

                 about <a href="#Compartmentalisations">Compartmentalisations</a>. Note that electrotonic length is dimensionless, and the term space constant

               Not all of this 3D information is relevant when modelling the Sections, sometimes just the surface area/axial resistance at a point

             and the membrane potential at each

<b>Morphology save format</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>There are two possible ways to save morphologies in neuroConstruct projects, both based on a mapping from the 
set of Java classes describing the cell internally in neuroConstruct:
<ul>
        
<li>XML based Java serialisation (*.java.xml files):  a mapping to an XML file of the classes. Note: not any part of NeuroML.</li>

<li>Serialised Java object form (*.java.ser files):   a serialised representation of the Java classes.</li>

</ul>
The second of these is quicker to load and save and the files are smaller. The first however can be opened (and edited!)
with a text editor. Change which format to use via <strong>Settings -&gt; General Properties &amp; Project Defaults/Project properties</strong>.

Cell morphologies are stored in the <strong>morphologies</strong> directory of the project home directory. *.bak files in that dir backup 
the previously stored morphology before a new one is saved (if a problem occurs saving a morphology, close the application, remove
the .bak from the name of the morphology file to use the previous structure of the cell when reloading the project).

Note that the cells aren't currently stored in neuroConstruct projects in <a href="#NeuroML">NeuroML</a>/<a href="#MorphML">MorphML</a> format, since new functionality 
is usually added to the neuroConstruct Cell class before it is supported in the specifications.</p>

<b>Packing Pattern</b>
</p>
</a><span>
<p>When cells are placed in a <a href="#Region">Region</a>, the somas need to be arranged in a particular pattern. In neuroConstruct, some of the available patterns are:
            <ul>
            
<li>
<strong>Random:</strong> Cells are placed in random locations in the Region</li>
            
<li>
<strong>Cubic Close Packed:</strong> Cells are placed in Cubic Close Packed formation. A layer is placed in 2D first and the spheres in the next layer lie on top, at the center of the 4 spheres underneath, touching each. This is optimal packing of spheres in 3D</li>
            
<li>
<strong>Simple Regular:</strong> The cells are placed in layers with cell centres directly above each other</li>
            
<li>
<strong>Single Placed Cell:</strong> A single cell is placed in an exact location in the Region (or relative to the origin)</li>
            
<li>
<strong>Hexagonal:</strong> The cells are placed in a single layer in a hexagonal pattern (each soma is surrounded by 6 other somas at equal angles)</li>
            
<li>
<strong>One Dimensional Regular Spacing:</strong> The cells are placed at regular intervals in a straight line </li>
            
</ul>
            Note that for each of these packing patterns a number of variables need to be specified, besides the Region, e.g. the number of cells to place, extra cell spacing
            whether to avoid existing cells from this (or other) <a href="#Cell Group">Cell Group</a>s.
            New packing patterns can be added by extending the Java class <strong>CellPackingAdapter</strong>.

<p>The basic unit of the morphological description of the cell. Segments correspond to the concept of a compartment as

             and the Segment end points provide the pt3d points along the section). A Segment has a unique name, an end point, a pointer to
             its <a href="#Section">Section</a>, a pointer to its parent <strong>Segment</strong>, and a value for the fraction (0 to 1) of the
             <strong>parent Segment's</strong> length at which it's connected. The first Segment in a Section can be connected at a point between 0 and 1 along
             its parent segment (which will be in another section) but all other segments need to be connected at the 1 point to their
             parent. Note: there is a difference with how NEURON handles sections, they specify the 0 to 1 point of connectivity along their
             parent section. When there are n Segments in a Section in neuroConstruct, this will translate to a NEURON section with n+1 pt3d points.

</a><span>
<p>Variables which change during the simulation can be specified to be plotted and/or saved for later display in neuroConstruct via
             the <strong>Input/Output</strong> tab. Variables have different names in each of the simulation environments (e.g. v or Vm), so a set of 
             generic names of the most common interesting values has been defined:
    <ul>
        
<li>
<strong>VOLTAGE</strong> for the membrane potential (v in NEURON, Vm in GENESIS)</li>
        
<li>
<strong>SPIKE</strong> can be used to record spike trains, as opposed to voltage at every timestep, e.g. <strong>SPIKE:-20</strong> sets the spike threshold to -20mV</li>
    
</ul>
    To plot a value present on a Cell Mechanism, use a colon, e.g. <strong>NaConductance:m</strong>. Note, as the gate activation
    variables are a special case, GENESIS will search through the list of gates (only if the Cell Mechanism is defined by a
    ChannelML file), search for a gate with the specified name, and plot that variable. See Ex4-NEURONGENESIS for an example. 
    Other named variables that can be plotted for Cell Mechanisms are:
    <ul>
        
<li>
<strong>CONC</strong> for the concentration of an ion, e.g. <strong>CaPool:CONC:ca</strong>
</li>
        
<li>
<strong>REV_POT</strong> for the reversal potential of an ion, e.g. <strong>NaConductance:REV_POT:na</strong>
</li>
        
<li>
<strong>CURR_DENS</strong> for the current density through a channel, e.g. <strong>NaConductance:CURR_DENS:na</strong>
