==============

This is neuroConstruct, software for developing 3D networks for 
biologically realistic neuronal simulations.    

More information can be found at: http://www.neuroConstruct.org

The application can be run via the desktop/Start Menu links if the automatic
installers have been used (http://www.neuroconstruct.org/download), or in a 
terminal with
